## Comments
As per my email to Richard and Nick, this assignment caught me in the middle of a hard time with a death in the family and unfortunately even though I spent upwards of five hours working on it when I could in between travelling for the funeral and helping with the family, I wasn't able to come close to finishing it. I am mostly just submitting so that you can see that I did attempt it and didn't just blow the assignment off.

As far as feedback for the assignment goes, I think converting a website to HTML5 and making it responsive all at once was extremely confusing and made it difficult to focus on one new skill. I realize that both of them are important skills to know how to do for real life practice, but for our first responsive transformation, adding the structure changes was very distracting, and unfortunately all that I was really able to get to before I ran out of time.
